Google Group Delete App - README.md 
===================================

First things first: Run this program at your own risk.
I did it within a few hours, because I could not find any solution online. The program is around 17 MB big, because I added all the libraries of Google API v3 for java. Many are not needed, but I didnt want go through them to see which I didnt use.
If you have the same problem (see below), I am more than happy to share my solution with you.

Problem
-------
A los of Groups in Google Contacts can not be deleted at the same time. You have to delete them manually. This app deletes all not-system-groups automatically.

Requirements
------------
Java - https://java.com/de/download/

Usage
-----

Download the released JAR (under the Release tab) and run in terminal/cmd in the same folder:

```
java -jar GoogleGroupDelete.jar
```
